iOS 9.0:
Voiceover reads "button", which is not a clear indication that this is an autocomplete field. When the user activates the button, VoiceOver reads "combo box". The keyboard appears on the screen, and as the user types, values change in the combo box and the default value is read automatically during typing.
</p>
<p>
iOS 8.4:
Voiceover reads "combo box, pop-up button", which is not a clear indication of an editable, autocomplete field.
However, once activated, the keyboard appears on the screen, as text is edited, the combo box updates as needed.
