			<p id="preamble">In their half year report, the specialty chemicals group Stelios reported a 20% increase in operating income, but a fall in profits and a sharp rise in debt as a result both of higher raw material costs and its acquisition of GChem plc's unwanted subsidiary, the fertiliser company RJG. In common with the majority of other chemical corporations Stelios have now officially pinned their hopes on an economic recovery in the second half of the year and the much anticipated raw material price drop. Following the announcement, the Stelios share price dropped 12% to a three year low, reflecting the market's continued concern over who will replace Peter Munn as Stelios' chairman and chief executive when he retires in two months.</p>
